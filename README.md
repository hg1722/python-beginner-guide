# Python Beginner Guide
Python is one of the hottest programming languages in computer science today. It's extremely powerful, and can be used to build anything from web applications to scripts for automating tedious activities. It's also the primary language used for machine learning (AI!). Python is also a very beginner-friendly language, and implicitly handles a lot of complex programming conventions like type-checking. This results in probably the beautiful code out of any programming language out there (in my opinion).


## How do I get started?
My methodology for learning a new programming language usually begins with some sort of resource to learn the syntax (the grammar of the language) and semantics (what the words in the language mean). Usually once you know one programming language, you can learn others very quickly as there is usually lots of overlap. After you're familiar with the language basics, the most important thing to do is apply the language: build, build, build! Creating projects allows you to truly understand the language.
tldr: learn language basics > do project > repeat step 2 again and again


## Courses (you only need to choose one)
LearnPython (https://www.learnpython.org/): Probably the most efficient course. Super quick to go through, teaches all the basics in a clean format and interactive exercises to help you practice. (I'd skim through this one if you are already familiar with programming in other languages)

Codeacademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python): Super beginner friendly, holds your hand. A bit slower but extremely interactive! (needs account, choose free course)

Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110): Video-based course with exercises mixed in. I learned through Udacity because I love learning through videos, but they replaced the course I used with this one. Should be really good, the course is free as well.

Build your own
Programming (especially Python) is super exciting because you can solve problems in your every day life. Maybe you need to copy/paste something 100 times for your homework or need to do some complicated calculation over and over again for a class. You can build these sort of things very easily in Python too!
